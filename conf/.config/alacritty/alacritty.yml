# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: screen-256color # this is what neovim needs
  #TERM: screen-256color # this is what neovim needs

window:

  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels. If both are zero this
  # setting is ignored.
  dimensions:

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is not scaled by

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Available values:

  # Values for `startup_mode`:

  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
  # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used to

  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you

  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
