## The problem

Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing (or the feature you want to see added to dotfiles). Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions.

## Environment

* OS: {Please write here}
* Zsh version: {Please write here}
* dotfiles version : {Please write here}

## Details

If necessary, describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail.

## Link to dotfiles logs

Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your _full_ Dotfiles logs, and link them here. 
Do _NOT_ paste your full Dotfiles logs here, as it will make this issue very long and hard to read! 
If you are reporting a bug, _always_ include Dotfiles logs!
