# Detect Mind Virus

Identify manipulative reasoning patterns that spread through cognitive exploitation rather than evidence.

## What Is a Mind Virus?

An idea that spreads by exploiting cognitive shortcuts (fear, guilt, identity, authority) while **resisting correction** through logic, evidence, or experience.

Key distinction: Having wrong beliefs is human. Spreading beliefs that **disable the ability to question them** is a mind virus.

## Cognitive Exploits Detected

| Exploit          | Pattern                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Fear             | "If you don't X, terrible Y will happen" |
| Guilt            | "Good people do X" (questioners are bad) |
| Identity         | "Real [group] believe X"                 |
| Authority        | "Experts agree" (unnamed, untestable)    |
| Zero-sum         | "Their gain is your loss"                |
| Unfalsifiability | Claims that cannot be tested             |

## Usage
