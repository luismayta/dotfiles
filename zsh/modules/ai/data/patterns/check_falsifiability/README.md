# Check Falsifiability

Evaluate whether claims can be proven wrong — the basic standard for legitimate knowledge.

## Why This Matters

An unfalsifiable claim cannot be corrected. For AGI safety, this is critical:

- An AI claiming "I am beneficial" with no test = unverifiable
- An AI claiming "I won't create unwilling victims" with specific criteria = testable

## The Test

**Falsifiable**: There exists some observation that would prove it wrong.

| Claim                                      | Falsifiable? | Why                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| "This drug works in 70% of patients"       | Yes          | A trial could show otherwise |
| "This drug works in ways we can't measure" | No           | No possible disconfirmation  |
| "True socialism has never been tried"      | No           | Any failure defined away     |
| "This policy reduces crime by 20%"         | Yes          | Statistics can confirm/deny  |

## Usage

```bash
# Check a policy claim
echo "This AI alignment approach ensures beneficial outcomes" | fabric -p check_falsifiability

# Audit a framework
cat constitution.md | fabric -p check_falsifiability

# Evaluate research claims
fabric -p check_falsifiability < paper_abstract.txt
```

## Key Principle

> "Error is not evil; refusing to correct it is."

Falsifiability is about testability, not about being wrong. A falsifiable claim can still be true — but it can be CHECKED.
