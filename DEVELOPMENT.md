Great to have you here! Here are a few ways you can help out with [Dotfiles](https://github.com/luismayta/dotfiles).

# Where should I start?

You can start learning about Dotfiles by reading [the documentation](https://github.com/luismayta/dotfiles).

## Your first commits

If you’re interested in contributing to Dotfiles, that’s awesome! We’d love your help.

If you have any questions after reading this page, please feel free to contact either
[@slovacus](https://github.com/luismayta) They are all happy to provide help working
through your first bug fix or thinking through the problem you’re trying to resolve.

## How you can help

We track [small bugs and features](https://github.com/luismayta/dotfiles/issues?labels=small)
so that anyone who wants to help can start with something that's not too overwhelming.
We also keep a [list of things anyone can help with, any time](https://github.com/luismayta/dotfiles/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing).
If nothing on those lists looks good, talk to us, and we'll figure out what you can help with.
We can absolutely use your help, no matter what level of programming skill you have at the moment.

# Development setup

Dotfiles doesn't use a Gemfile to list development dependencies,
because when we tried it we couldn't tell if we were awake or it was just another level of dreams.
To work on Dotfiles, you'll probably want to do a couple of things.
