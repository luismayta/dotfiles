Contributing
============

There are a lot of different ways to contribute to Dotfiles. See below for
everything you can do and the processes to follow for each contribution
method. Note that no matter how you contribute, your participation is
governed by our `Code of Conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`__.

Make changes to code or docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fork the project, make a change, and send a pull request! Please have a
look at our `Style
Guide </docs/source/contributing/style-guide.rst>`__ before
getting to work. Please make sure the unit and functional tests pass
before sending a pull request; for more information on how to run tests,
keep reading!

Make sure you read and follow the setup instructions in the README
first. And note that all participation in the Dotfiles community
(including code submissions) is governed by our `Code of
Conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`__. Then, have a look at our `running from source
doc </docs/source/contributing/source.rst>`__ for more
information on how to get set up to run tests and start slinging code.

You will probably also want to have a look at this more in-depth
`Developer's

the Dotfiles project, how Dotfiles is architected, how to make changes to
modules, and so on.
