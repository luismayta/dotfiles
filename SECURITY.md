# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the dotfiles projects, we'd love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

There are two ways to report a security bug. The easiest is to email a description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version) to [security at dotfiles dot org](mailto:security@hadenlabs.com).
